# README

[![Gitter channel](https://badges.gitter.im/libopencm3/discuss.svg)](https://gitter.im/1bitsy/Lobby)

This repository contains assorted example projects for the 1BitSy development platform.

## Usage

To be able to compile the examples included in this repository you will requiere
an arm-none-eabi gcc toolchain. We recommend you install the gcc-arm-embedded
toolchain that is being maintained by ARM. The downloads and installation
instructions for Linux (Ubuntu), Mac OS X and Windows can be found on the
[gcc-arm-embedded Launchpad page](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/).

You _must_ run "make" in the top level directory first.  This builds the
library and all examples.  If you're simply hacking on a single example after
that, you can type "make clean; make" in any of the individual project
directories later.

For more verbose output, to see compiler command lines, use "make V=1"
For insanity levels of verboseness, use "make V=99"

The makefiles are generally useable for your own projects with
only minimal changes for the libopencm3 install path (See Reuse)

## Make Flash Target
For flashing the 'miniblink' example (after you built libopencm3 and the
examples by typing 'make' at the top-level directory) onto the 1bitsy, you can
execute:

    cd examples/1bitsy/miniblink
    make flash

The Makefiles of the examples are configured to use a Black Magic Probe by
default, and will list possible serial ports that it found for you to choose
from.

You can also provide the serial port you want directly to the target so that
you don't have to choose by invoking:

    cd examples/1bitsy/miniblink
    make flash BMP_PORT=/dev/ttyACM0

You can also use the dfu-util to upload the selected firmware by running:

    cd examples/1bitsy/miniblink
    make dfu-flash

## Flashing Manually
You can also flash manually. Using a miriad of different tools depending on
your setup. Here are a few examples.

### Black Magic Probe

    cd examples/1bitsy/fancyblink
    arm-none-eabi-gdb miniblink.elf
    target extended-remote /dev/ttyACM0
    monitor swdp_scan
    attach 1
    load
    run

To exit the gdb session type `<Ctrl>-C` and `<Ctrl>-D`. It is useful to add the
following to the .gdbinit to make the flashing and debugging easier:

    set target-async on
    set confirm off
    set mem inaccessible-by-default off
    #set debug remote 1
    tar ext /dev/ttyACM0
    mon version
    mon swdp_scan
    att 1

Having this in your .gdbinit boils down the flashing/debugging process to:

    cd examples/1bitsy/fancyblink
    arm-none-eabi-gdb miniblink.elf
    load
    run


### DFU-Util

If you put your 1Bitsy in the DFU Bootloader mode (having the DFU Bootloader
jumper shorted while you plug in the USB cable for example) you will be able to
use the following command to upload your firmware:

    cd examples/1bitsy/fancyblink
    make fancyblink.bin
    sudo dfu-util -d 0483:df11 -c 1 -a 0 -s 0x08000000:leave -D fancyblink.bin

For this to work you will need dfu-util V0.8 or newer!

## Reuse

If you want to use any of the code found here in your own project, this
examples repository shows the general way. There is also a
1bitsy-locm3-template repository that can serve as a basis for your project.

1. Create an empty repository

       mkdir mycoolrobot && cd mycoolrobot && git init .

2. Add libopencm3 as a submodule

       git submodule add https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3

3. Grab a copy of the basic rules

These urls grab the latest from the libopencm3-examples repository

       wget \
         https://raw.githubusercontent.com/libopencm3/libopencm3-examples/master/examples/rules.mk \
         -O libopencm3.rules.mk

4. Grab a copy of your target Makefile in this case, for STM32F4

       wget \
         https://raw.githubusercontent.com/libopencm3/libopencm3-examples/master/examples/stm32/f4/Makefile.include \
         -O libopencm3.target.mk

5. Edit paths in `libopencm3.target.mk`

Edit the _last_ line of `libopencm3.target.mk` and change the include to read
include `../libopencm3.rules.mk` (the amount of .. depends on where you put your
project in the next step).

6. Beg/borrow/steal an example project

For sanity's sake, use the same target as the makefile you grabbed up above.

       cp -a \
         somewhere/libopencm3-examples/examples/stm32/f4/stm32f4-discovery/miniblink \
         myproject

Add the path to `OPENCM3_DIR , set the right `DEVICE` and modify the path to
makefile include:

    diff -u
    --- Makefile.orig       2017-06-11 12:42:25.378248089 +0200
    +++ Makefile    2017-06-11 12:46:42.566244271 +0200
    @@ -19,7 +19,8 @@
     
     BINARY = miniblink
     
    -DEVICE=STM32F407VG
    +OPENCM3_DIR = ../libopencm3
    +DEVICE = STM32F415RGT6
     
    -include ../../Makefile.include
    +include ../libopencm3.target.mk

You're done :)

You need to run "make" inside the libopencm3 directory once to build the
library, then you can just run make/make clean in your project directory as
often as you like.
